# COMP6741 Assignment 3
## 1. Abstract
1. This repository collaborates on the group assignment of UNSW course COMP6741.
2. The group consists of following members:
    - z5407459  Tianrui Wang  
    - z5158488  Yuedong Li  
    - z5386034  Sixiang Qiu
3. Among the three alternatives in the assignment, **Alternative 3 - educational** is selected.
4. Specifically, this repository aims to develop an interact widget on the topic **branching algorithms**.
## 2. Description of contents
1. This repository consists of three folders. Each folder contains an implementation and visualization of the following algorithms, namely:
    - Vertex cover algorithm (**SPECIAL**)
    - Feedback vertex set
    - Maximum leaf spanning tree
2. Each folder is named after the alogrithm it realized.
3. **Specially**, folder for vertex cover algorithm contains three different files as belowed:
    |file name|comment|
    |-|-|
    |SR for VC|simplification rule|
    |vc-algo|implementation|
    |interact version|interactive widget| 
4. Besides the independant version, a merged version is provided in the root directory together with the project report.
## 3. Instructions
1. To run the code, it requires the following environment:
    - SageMath 9.5
    - Python
    - Juypter Notebook
2. Once the environment is set ready, open the .*ipynb* file and run the code block with SageMath kernel. The result should be well displayed under.
